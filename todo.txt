when going from an off day to a normal day, need to think through how to manage other registrations for that date as to not fuck up balances et.c.

need top add day type writing on end registration (and for updated start)

should cmd/main.go perform all staging of activities? I.E call write end time, then call for rebalancing, off day registration et.c. or should the registration.go manage all logic?
